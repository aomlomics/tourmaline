# FILTER FEATURES AFTER DENOISING
# Set minimum and maximum sequence lengths to filter representative sequences by.
# Limits are inclusive, ie, greater than or equal to minimum, less than or equal to maximum.
# For more info run: qiime feature-table filter-seqs --help
# TO SKIP FILTERING BY LENGTH: set values to extreme values, eg (0, 10000)
